        An unfinished program that was originally on itch.io 
        but during the creation of this website I decided to move it to GitHub and remove the itch.io version
        this product is pretty bad even though the full release might be better, I am thinking of making a 2.0 version.
        I'm not expecting to for this program to be popular becuase not only it is my first program
        but the story was pretty lazily writen.
